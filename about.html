<h1> What makes anime better</h1>
<h2>Morals and principles ;)</h2>
<div class="column-2">
    <p> In reality anime is just an adult cartoon, in my opinion. Anime shows different asspects and beliefs in life, which is what makes it intruiging. Furthermore, from watching anime you can learn life lessons and implement them into your own daily life.</p>
    <p> For instance, a lot of people dont have real friends, and i dont mean friends that you hang with and may even talk to everyday. As in friends, i mean the ones who arent buddies even when they may disagree and have different perspectives, but somehow they are still friends. Most people in life are only friends with whom are agreeable and similar.</p>

<h2 class="clear"> Comedy;)</h2>
<div class="column-3">
    <p> Not all anime is rainbows and laughter, but when the comedic relief is displayed its very hilarious.A lot of times shows have certain characters to be the comedic relief when the theme is more gloomy
         and plot based. For instance, "Attack on Titan" this show is very dark and i actually need to finish season 4.

    <p> Moreover, let me tell you about my girl sasha. Her combat/fighting IQ was very standard yet useful. She was way more ditsy and foolish than most characters in the show plus she was raised in the woods. Whenever she had screen time my girl was in her own world or trying to steal food. Also my girl was greedy but she shared with her fellow pupils.</p>

<h2 class="clear"> Graphics and creativity</h2>
<br>
<div class="column-4">
    <p> The quality of graphics you see in anime isnt like any other and i can vouch. As time passes, the graphics become better and better which is very awsome to me. I love detail especially in fighting scenes cause it makes it even more intense. When seeing, someone fighting with a sword and than the antagonist may have a special ability, depending on the graphics the swordman might look like a god. </p>
